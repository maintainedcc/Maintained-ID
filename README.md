# Maintained-ID
Identity &amp; authentication for Maintained services

## Flow

1. User authenticates with GitHub using Maintained GitHub app (public scope only)
2. User is redirected to id.maintained.cc with OAuth code, state
3. Maintained-ID uses GitHub to translate this into a GitHub token
4. Maintained-ID uses token to retrieve user's GitHub UUID (username)
5. UUID is signed into a JWT which is returned to the user
6. JWT can now be used across any Maintained service to authenticate
